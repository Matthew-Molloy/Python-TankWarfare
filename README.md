# 381Final

Tank Warfare is a 2-player third-person shooter, where each player controls a tank. The objective of the game is to eliminate the enemy tank. In order to play, you must plug in two Dualshock 4 (PS4) controllers. You can play by downloading the game on Linux, unzipping, and running the "main" executable. The game was created with the Python-Ogre framework, a Python wrapper for the Ogre3D library (wiki.python-ogre.org).
